Sentiment Analysis For Code-Mixed Social Media Text.

Abstract: Code-mixing is the phenomenon of using multiple languages in the same utterance of a text and is a frequently used pattern of communication on various platforms
such as social media sites, product reviews, etc. Sentiment analysis of the codemixed text is a challenging task due to the non-standard writing style. In this project, I implemented did data pre-processing of Hinglish (Hindi-English) Tweets and present an ensemble architecture of CNN and LSTM for sentiment analysis.
